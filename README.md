# Qbias News Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores bias in news articles using the Qbias dataset, a collection of 21,747 articles labeled with political bias categories (`Left`, `Center`, `Right`). The primary goal is to analyze patterns of bias, classify articles by bias, and generate summaries while retaining neutrality.

## Features
- **Dataset Analysis:** Explore and preprocess text data to identify bias trends.
- **Bias Classification:** Train machine learning and transformer models to classify articles by bias labels.
- **Summarization:** Experiment with extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.
- **Visualizations:** Present bias distributions, sentiment trends, and model performance.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Qbias GitHub Repository
- **Details:** News articles labeled for political bias.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing text (stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.).
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyze sentiment, word frequency, and bias trends.
3. **Modeling:** Train classifiers and fine-tune transformers for bias detection.
4. **Summarization:** Use NLP techniques for article summarization.
